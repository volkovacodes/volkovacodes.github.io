Agencies’ bestowment of favors appears to be motivated by opportunities within the private sector: lobbying is significantly greater among agencies that have stronger revolving door relations with the private sector.

Executive Summary\nRegulatory Fragmentation The federal government is arguably the most influential actor in the United States economy. Its agenda includes a wide range of activities, and these activities are carried out daily by hundreds of agencies. We examine regulatory fragmentation: the extent to which the regulation of certain issues is spread across multiple agencies. For example, under current rules, climate disclosures fall under the purview of both the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). As another example, firms in the financial industry must satisfy regulations by the Federal Reserve, the Treasury Department, and the CFTC, to name just a few. We document three main findings. First, there is substantial regulatory fragmentation across federal agencies in the United States. Second, regulatory fragmentation increases firms’ costs while lowering their productivity, profitability, and growth. Third, regulatory fragmentation deters entry into an industry. Measuring the wide range of government activities To quantify the government’s activities, we take advantage of the comprehensive information contained within the Federal Register (FR). The FR is the official daily publication of the federal government, and it details the activities of all the major federal agencies. Surprisingly, nearly half of the FR relates to activities other than formal rulemaking. These include lesser-known government actions such as meetings, hearings, and transactions approvals, all grouped under the inconspicuous title “notices.” This is the first quick takeaway: ignoring this component of the government’s agenda (as academic studies tend to do) would miss a significant portion of the government’s activities. We use machine learning techniques to categorize FR activities into 100 topics. While many past studies find an increase in government activity over time, we highlight how this trend varies across topics. For example, “Environment: data \u0026amp; studies” has increased steadily over time, whereas “Aviation safety: inspection” has declined. Our measure also provides a unique perspective on two of the biggest shocks to the government agenda over the past 25 years: the 2008-09 financial crisis and the 2016 presidential election. Regulatory Fragmentation Measure We develop a measure of regulatory fragmentation, which captures the extent to which each individual topic is regulated by multiple federal agencies. Our measure is analogous to the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI): an issue that is regulated by only one agency is highly concentrated, and thus has the lowest possible fragmentation. We find that the least fragmented topic is “Securities: investment companies,” a highly specialized topic that is regulated by only a handful of financial agencies. In contrast, “Government Procurement: Small Businesses” is one of the most fragmented topics, handled by several dozen agencies. Using machine learning techniques, we identify the set of regulatory topics that are relevant to each firm, and we weight each of these topics by their relative importance to the firm. We find that regulatory fragmentation is a fundamental issue for U.S. companies. The typical firm’s business model relates to multiple regulatory topics, and each topic is spread across multiple agencies. In other words, many firms are accountable to numerous regulatory bodies. Interestingly, the firm’s regulatory fragmentation is not strongly correlated with other characteristics such as size and total regulatory burden. Real effects of regulatory fragmentation We find that regulatory fragmentation is costly for firms. First, firms that face greater regulatory fragmentation have higher Sales, General, and Administrative (SG\u0026amp;A) costs. Since these firms must answer to more government agencies, they devote more resources to government relations and to regulatory compliance. Second, firms with greater regulatory fragmentation also have lower productivity, profitability, and sales and asset growth. This evidence is consistent with the idea that an increased regulatory burden diverts resources away from more value-increasing efforts. Next, we examine how regulatory fragmentation affects hiring policies. One possibility is that the regulatory burden reduces the net present value of potential projects, forcing companies to hire fewer people. Alternatively, companies may need to hire …","date":1743465600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1743465600,"objectID":"448f018b96c36ef8a8e1908fb5cd5bff","permalink":"https://www.evolkova.info/research/fragmentation/","publishdate":"2025-04-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/research/fragmentation/","section":"research","summary":"**The Journal of Finance** (2025)\nBest paper award at FMARC conference\nBest paper award at CAFM conference Presented at AFA, Future of Financial Information Conference, Financial Research Network (FIRN), APRCF Conference, Copenhagen Business School, the Federal Reserve, George Mason University, University of Rochester, Boston College, University of Toronto, University of Melbourne, University of Washington, Wayne State University, Florida International University, University of Bath, University of Bristol.\n","tags":["regulation","government activity","regulatory fragmentation","productivity"],"title":"Regulatory Fragmentation","type":"research"},{"authors":["Tania Babina","Simcha Barkai","Jessica Jeffers","Ezra Karger","Ekaterina Volkova"],"categories":null,"content":"Presented at EFA, AEA and NBER SI, Boston College, the Center for Equitable Growth, Columbia University, the Department of Justice Antitrust Division, Emory University, the Entrepreneurship Junior Group Online Seminars, the Labor and Finance Group Conference, NYU WARPFIN Conference, the Stigler Center for the Study of the Economy and the State, the Stigler Center 2023 Antitrust and Competition Conference, the University of Melbourne, and the University of Warwick Abstract: We hand-collect and standardize information describing all 3,055 antitrust lawsuits brought by the Department of Justice (DOJ) between 1971 and 2018. Using restricted establishment-level microdata from the U.S. Census, we compare the economic outcomes of a non-tradable industry in states targeted by DOJ antitrust lawsuits to outcomes of the same industry in other states that were not targeted. We document that DOJ antitrust enforcement actions permanently increase employment by 5.4% and business formation by 4.1%. Using an event-study design, we find (1) a sharp increase in payroll that exceeds the increase in employment, meaning that DOJ antitrust enforcement increases average wages, (2) an economically smaller increase in sales that is statistically insignificant, and (3) a precise increase in the labor share. While we cannot separately measure the quantity and price of output, the increase in production inputs (employment), together with a proportionally smaller increase in sales, strongly suggests that these DOJ antitrust enforcement actions increase the quantity of output and simultaneously decrease the price of output. Our results show that government antitrust enforcement leads to persistently higher levels of economic activity in targeted industries.

Abstract: We find that blockholder diversity, i.e., the firm shareholder base including several different types of blocks, is detrimental to firm performance. We show that lagged disclosure, on exogenous predetermined dates, that reveals an increase in block diversity is followed by a negative market reaction. Firms held by heterogeneous blockholders consistently perform worse than firms held by homogeneous blockholders. Block diversity is particularly detrimental when uncertainty is high. Disagreement among shareholders (e.g., as reflected in the frequency of lawsuits being filed) increases when the blockholder base is diverse. We make our blockholder dataset public for the benefit of other researchers. Metaphorical Summary: The image below is an illustration from a famous fable penned by the Russian poet Ivan Krylov, \u0026#34;The Swan, the Crayfish, and the Pike.\u0026#34; In this allegorical tale, three animals attempt to pull a wagon together. However, due to their distinct methods and conflicting directions - the swan flying upward, the crayfish crawling backward, and the pike diving into the water - they fail to move the wagon. This lack of coordination and cooperation exemplifies how a failure to align on common goals can lead to complete stagnation. Similarly, in our paper, we explore the dynamics between large shareholders, or blockholders, of different types. Though these shareholders may aim to work in concert, diverging incentives and preferences often render their attempts counterproductive. This modern application of Krylov\u0026#39;s timeless message underscores the critical importance of cohesion and aligned interests in the world of corporate finance.

Using a comprehensive measure based on the language of over 30 million news articles from more than 200 newspapers, we analyze the impact of three major acquisitions between 2016 and 2019. Employing a synthetic difference-in-differences approach, we find that acquisitions can significantly shift newspapers’ political slant, with effects varying by acquiring entity. News Corp’s 2016 acquisition led to a marked conservative shift in newspapers it already owned, while subsequent acquisitions by Nine Entertainment and the acquisition of Australian Community Media by Antony Catalano and Alex Waislitz resulted in shifts away from conservative slant in acquired newspapers. Our results provide evidence for the importance of supply-side factors in determining media slant, particularly in an era of increasing media ownership concentration.

To evaluate the regulator’s input, we analyze these communications between the SEC and firms using LDA-analysis and KL-divergence. Main topics of SEC concerns map closely into the regulator’s stated mandate: companies increase prospectus disclosures within precise topics of SEC concern. Questions related to revenue recognition are most informative about company valuation. These concerns are not independently uncovered by investors. This dynamic process of information disclosure results in increased transparency, but at a cost of delays in going public.

You can focus on the content and Wowchemy handles the rest.\nHighlight your code snippets, take notes on math classes, and draw diagrams from textual representation.\nOn this page, you’ll find some examples of the types of technical content that can be rendered with Wowchemy.\nExamples Code Wowchemy supports a Markdown extension for highlighting code syntax. You can customize the styles under the syntax_highlighter option in your config/_default/params.yaml file.\n```python import pandas as pd data = pd.read_csv(\u0026#34;data.csv\u0026#34;) data.head() ``` renders as\nimport pandas as pd data = pd.read_csv(\u0026#34;data.csv\u0026#34;) data.head() Mindmaps Wowchemy supports a Markdown extension for mindmaps.\nSimply insert a Markdown markmap code block and optionally set the height of the mindmap as shown in the example below.\nA simple mindmap defined as a Markdown list:\n```markmap {height=\u0026#34;200px\u0026#34;} - Hugo Modules - wowchemy - wowchemy-plugins-netlify - wowchemy-plugins-netlify-cms - wowchemy-plugins-reveal ``` renders as\n- Hugo Modules - wowchemy - wowchemy-plugins-netlify - wowchemy-plugins-netlify-cms - wowchemy-plugins-reveal A more advanced mindmap with formatting, code blocks, and math:\n```markmap - Mindmaps - Links - [Wowchemy Docs](https://wowchemy.com/docs/) - [Discord Community](https://discord.gg/z8wNYzb) - [GitHub](https://github.com/wowchemy/wowchemy-hugo-themes) - Features - Markdown formatting - **inline** ~~text~~ *styles* - multiline text - `inline code` - ```js console.log(\u0026#39;hello\u0026#39;); console.log(\u0026#39;code block\u0026#39;); ``` - Math: $x = {-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2-4ac} \\over 2a}$ ``` renders as\n- Mindmaps - Links - [Wowchemy Docs](https://wowchemy.com/docs/) - [Discord Community](https://discord.gg/z8wNYzb) - [GitHub](https://github.com/wowchemy/wowchemy-hugo-themes) - Features - Markdown formatting - **inline** ~~text~~ *styles* - multiline text - `inline code` - ```js console.log(\u0026#39;hello\u0026#39;); console.log(\u0026#39;code block\u0026#39;); ``` - Math: $x = {-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2-4ac} \\over 2a}$ Charts Wowchemy supports the popular Plotly format for interactive charts.\nSave your Plotly JSON in your page folder, for example line-chart.json, and then add the {{\u0026lt; chart data=\u0026#34;line-chart\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} shortcode where you would like the chart to appear.\nDemo:\nYou might also find the Plotly JSON Editor useful.\nMath Wowchemy supports a Markdown extension for $\\LaTeX$ math. You can enable this feature by toggling the math option in your config/_default/params.yaml file.\nTo render inline or block math, wrap your LaTeX math with {{\u0026lt; math \u0026gt;}}$...${{\u0026lt; /math \u0026gt;}} or {{\u0026lt; math \u0026gt;}}$$...$${{\u0026lt; /math \u0026gt;}}, respectively. (We wrap the LaTeX math in the Wowchemy math shortcode to prevent Hugo rendering our math as Markdown. The math shortcode is new in v5.5-dev.)\nExample math block:\n{{\u0026lt; math \u0026gt;}} $$ \\gamma_{n} = \\frac{ \\left | \\left (\\mathbf x_{n} - \\mathbf x_{n-1} \\right )^T \\left [\\nabla F (\\mathbf x_{n}) - \\nabla F (\\mathbf x_{n-1}) \\right ] \\right |}{\\left \\|\\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n}) - \\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n-1}) \\right \\|^2} $$ {{\u0026lt; /math \u0026gt;}} renders as\n$$\\gamma_{n} = \\frac{ \\left | \\left (\\mathbf x_{n} - \\mathbf x_{n-1} \\right )^T \\left [\\nabla F (\\mathbf x_{n}) - \\nabla F (\\mathbf x_{n-1}) \\right ] \\right |}{\\left \\|\\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n}) - \\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n-1}) \\right \\|^2}$$ Example inline math {{\u0026lt; math \u0026gt;}}$\\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n})${{\u0026lt; /math \u0026gt;}} renders as $\\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n})$.\nExample multi-line math using the math linebreak (\\\\):\n{{\u0026lt; math \u0026gt;}} $$f(k;p_{0}^{*}) = \\begin{cases}p_{0}^{*} \u0026amp; \\text{if }k=1, \\\\ 1-p_{0}^{*} \u0026amp; \\text{if }k=0.\\end{cases}$$ {{\u0026lt; /math \u0026gt;}} renders as\n$$ f(k;p_{0}^{*}) = \\begin{cases}p_{0}^{*} \u0026amp; \\text{if }k=1, \\\\ 1-p_{0}^{*} \u0026amp; \\text{if }k=0.\\end{cases} $$ Diagrams Wowchemy supports a Markdown extension for diagrams. You can enable this feature by toggling the diagram option in your config/_default/params.toml file or by adding diagram: true to your page front matter.\nAn example flowchart:\n```mermaid graph TD A[Hard] --\u0026gt;|Text| B(Round) B --\u0026gt; C{Decision} C --\u0026gt;|One| D[Result 1] C --\u0026gt;|Two| E[Result 2] ``` renders as\ngraph TD A[Hard] --\u0026gt;|Text| B(Round) B --\u0026gt; C{Decision} C --\u0026gt;|One| D[Result 1] C --\u0026gt;|Two| E[Result 2] An example sequence diagram:\n```mermaid sequenceDiagram Alice-\u0026gt;\u0026gt;John: Hello John, how are you? loop Healthcheck John-\u0026gt;\u0026gt;John: Fight against hypochondria end Note right of John: Rational thoughts!
